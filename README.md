# Frontend Mentor - Base Apparel coming soon page solution

This is a solution to the [Base Apparel coming soon page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0). 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I suspect there are more efficent ways to style this page. The styling could be written with SCSS to reduce the coding. Standard JS was used since the call functions were basic. JQuery might help further reduce the code.
